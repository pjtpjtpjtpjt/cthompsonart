## Method behind the madness
This website was first and foremost designed to showcase the artist's work. Hence the home page that shows, immediately, all the art he has available to display.

It was also designed to make it easy to purchase art. Simplicity was the goal: A *select* to make some quick choices and corresponding PayPal buttons.
